Project - Yearly Airline Performance Report

Introduction:

In the project, you will function as a data analyst where you have been given a task to monitor and report U.S. domestic airline flight performance. The goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability. You will create a dashboard using a U.S. airline reporting carrier on-time performance dataset, Plotly, and Dash concepts. 

Two components of the report items: 

1. Yearly airline performance report (For the chosen year provided): 
- Number of flights under different cancellation categories using a bar chart.
- Average flight time by reporting airline using a line chart.
- Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.
- Number of flights flying from each state using a choropleth map.
- Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using a treemap chart.

2. Yearly average flight delay statistics (For the chosen year provided):
- Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.
